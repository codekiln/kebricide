* This is a project that uses the Max for Live extension in Ableton Live, the sound editing software. 
* The /src/ directory contain typescript such as [index.ts](mdc:src/index.ts) and [utils.ts](mdc:src/utils.ts), which are the source code compiled into the Project/ directory as [index.js](mdc:Project/index.js) and [utils.js](mdc:Project/utils.js).
* JavaScript is executed in the context of the `js` object in Cycling 74's Max/MSP programming language, which doesn't have access to any globals in the environment from the browser such as `window`, or any other globals from node.js available. Max's `js` object globals are available at [Basic Javascript programming: Global Methods - Max 8 Documentation](mdc:https:/docs.cycling74.com/legacy/max8/vignettes/jsglobal).
